## File contents:
1) total cycles (for every species)
2) Association values for every speices (Beta-regression model for Microbial cycles~social cycles + social degree + microbial degree + (1|Village)
3) Null permutation values (Association coefficients from randomized villages)
4) Regression validation plots for Microbial cycles~social cycles model for linear, Neg-binom, and beta reg model.
5) Regression validation overlap plots (only for sig. species from assc model) for linear, Neg-binom, and beta reg model.
